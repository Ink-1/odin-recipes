    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A red cabagne dish with lots of nutrients and healing powers. This recipe has been passed down for thousands of years.
    Primitive slow cooking methods released the toxic chemicals found within the cabagne and nutralized them, making
    the cabagne edible for tribes accross the globe. Some say the cabagne would heal warriors coming home from battle. Broken 
    limbs, jarred skin, or even pulminary infections were known to heal quickly after consuming this dish. Traders on the eastern
    sea were known to sell the cabagne at a very high price, and it was well known to pirates for obvious reasons. The red village
    made the majority of its profits from exporting this good accross the globe.</p>
