## Self Reflection

I learned that programming is like riding a bike, it's all starting to come back to me.
Using HTML I built simple pages - a home page and three individual receipe pages. Then
I styled them very simply. The HTML was alright, and the CSS with flex box and position-
ing items was a bit tricky as well; trial and error to see what the code will do. Check
if things are aligned, tweak it a bit, and just take it to where I want it to go.

I decided on simple colors with a minimal theme. Square images and Japanese fonts. 
Navigation is accessible via home page layout and a back button. All in all I am 
pretty happy with how it turned out. I made it mobile friendly as well. Using bare css.
I am proud of myself for achieving a good clean aesthetic and useful design.
